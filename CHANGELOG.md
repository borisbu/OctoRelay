```

### 2.2.4

- Fixed UI/UX bug.
  - Hover state made responsive, similar to native OctoPrint buttons.
  - Emoji-based buttons are enlarged slightly in order to align with image-based ones.

  - Read only users are prohibited from switching the relays.
  - Thanks to [@plazarch](https://github.com/plazarch) for reporting the important security flaw.
- This version introduces a custom permission: "Relay switching".
  - The following groups are granted that permission by default: admins and users (operators).
  - You can allow relay switching to other ones in "Access control" section of OctoPrint settings.

  - Thanks to [@jneilliii](https://github.com/jneilliii) for the contribution.

### 2.0.1

- Fixed turning non-inverted relays ON and executing the corresponding optional OS Command when start printing.
  - Thanks to [@NDR008](https://github.com/NDR008) contribution, the issue
    [#46](https://github.com/borisbu/OctoRelay/issues/46) most is likely resolved.
- Fixed incorrect description of OS Command setting in the documentation.
- Plugin executable code now has `99%` test coverage.
  - All following contributions, features and fixes should take this into account.
  

### 2.0.0

- **Breaking changes**
  - Minimal Python version required: `3.7`.
  - Minimal JavaScript version support required: `ES6` (aka ES2015).
    - Minimal browser versions supporting ES6 are listed [here](https://caniuse.com/?search=es6).
  - The distributed PNG icons are replaced with SVG ones.
    - In case you've been using them in your configuration (`Icon ON/OFF`), you need to change their filenames:
      - `3d-printer.png` –> `3d-printer.svg`,
      - `fan-24.png` –> `fan.svg`,
      - `webcam.png` –> `webcam.svg`.
    - `refresh.png` icon is removed from the distribution.
